# Introduction to the Problem

A survey is submitted to 15 customers of a restaurant asking them if 5
different aspects of the restaurant should be improved, namely

-   M1 = variety of starters

-   M2 = variety of first dishes

-   M3 = variety of cakes

-   M4 = speed of service

-   M5 = availability of parking

The collected data are stored in the file data6.csv. Higher grades
correspond to an advice of bigger improvement, while low grades mean
that the customer is satisfied of the present situation.
